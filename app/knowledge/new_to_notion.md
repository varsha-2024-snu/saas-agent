### What is a block?

Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱

### Create a page

Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄

### Create a subpage

There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑

### What is a database?

Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄

### Create a database

Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈
